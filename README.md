Repository with coding task

 Hi! my name is Maciej and I'm Computer Science student at Cracow University of Technology. I don't have
any commercial experience in coding yet, but I really want to learn new skills 
and develop in that field. Throughout the following year I've gained some experience
in C and C++, but I would really like to have an opportunity to polish my coding
skills and learn new technologies. I can confidently say that I would like coding 
to become my way to make a living.
